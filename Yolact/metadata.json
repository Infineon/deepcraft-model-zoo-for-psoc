  "long_description": "The YOLACT Person Segmentation Model enables real-time person segmentation with efficient edge computing. It accurately detects, segments, and counts individuals in a given frame, making it ideal for embedded vision applications. Optimized for low-power, high-performance inference, it ensures fast and precise segmentation. This model enhances human presence detection for security, surveillance, and smart monitoring systems. The model can detect and segment more than one person in a given frame simultaneously while providing the total person count. Segmentation remains stable for up to five people in a single frame. These capabilities make it highly reliable for real-time applications requiring multiple-person detection and tracking.",
