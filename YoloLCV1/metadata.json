  "description": "Efficient human presence detection",
  "long_description": "The Yolo LC v1 is a real-time object detection model designed for real-time processing and implemented in TensorFlow. It has been trained on the COCO person dataset and is specifically used for person detection tasks. ST Yolo LC v1 is a real-time object detection model engineered specifically for person detection tasks on edge devices. This specialized implementation delivers efficient human presence detection with optimized performance characteristics for deployment in resource-constrained computing environments. The model has been quantized to the INT8 format using the TensorFlow Lite converter. ST Yolo LC v1 represents a highly specialized object detection solution, concentrating exclusively on human presence detection to deliver superior performance in edge computing environments where both speed and accuracy are essential.",
