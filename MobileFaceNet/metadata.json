  "long_description": "MobileFaceNet is a lightweight, efficient deep learning model specifically engineered for facial recognition applications on mobile and embedded devices. Built upon a modified MobileNetV2 architecture, this model incorporates depthwise separable convolutions to significantly reduce computational requirements while maintaining accuracy.Trained on the comprehensive MS-Celeb-1M dataset, MobileFaceNet delivers robust feature extraction capabilities for face verification and recognition tasks. The model employs an optimized backbone with a streamlined parameter count to enhance processing speed and operational efficiency.MobileFaceNet performs with high accuracy on frontal-facing subjects and individuals without eyewear that obscures key facial features. The system may experience reduced recognition accuracy when facial elements, particularly the eyes, are significantly concealed.",
