  "long_description": "ArcFace Face Recognition is a deep learning-based system that utilizes angular margin loss for accurate face verification. It processes facial images to extract identity-specific embeddings, ensuring robust recognition across varying poses, lighting, and occlusions. The model employs advanced feature extraction and normalization techniques to enhance accuracy in dynamic environments. Unlike traditional methods, it optimizes angular separation in the feature space to improve classification and matching performance. This approach enables high-precision facial recognition for applications in security, biometric authentication, and identity verification.",
