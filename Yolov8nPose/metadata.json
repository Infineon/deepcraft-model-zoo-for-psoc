  "description": "Lightweight model for multi pose estimation",
  "long_description": "Yolov8n_pose is a lightweight and efficient model designed for multi pose estimation tasks. It is part of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) family of models, known for their real-time object detection capabilities. The \"n\" in Yolov8n_pose indicates that it is a nano version, optimized for speed and resource efficiency, making it suitable for deployment on devices with limited computational power, such as mobile devices and embedded systems.",
