# DEEPCRAFT™ - Model Zoo for PSOC™ 

This repository contains different models that can be deployed on PSOC™ devices - these models are all machine learning based. Various projects can be found in here and you can use the projects to deploy different kinds of models onto the PSOC™ hardware. You can use this content to learn how to deploy different kinds of models onto the PSOC™ portfolio & to also see the full capability across different model types, domains and applications.

Within the different projects you will find:
* Models or different access points for trained models
* Code for deployment
* HEx files so you can test out the models straight away

## Usage
These projects can be integrated into your application using the library or model files or directly deployed on the device. See the individual readme files to learn more about each project and see the metadata.json files to learn more about the kinds of sensors, target devices & applications.

## Contribution
All users are welcome to submit new models/projects, subject to the DEEPCRAFT™ - Model Zoo for PSOC™ review process. See contributing guide for more details.
