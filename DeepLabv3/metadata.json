  "long_description": "DeepLabv3 MobileNetv2 ASPPv2 is a lightweight semantic segmentation model that combines DeepLabv3's powerful Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPPv2) with the efficient MobileNetv2 backbone. It excels at capturing multi-scale contextual information while remaining highly optimized for mobile and edge devices. This design achieves a strong balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, making it ideal for real-time person segmentation tasks.",
